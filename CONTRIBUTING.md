 * Open Tools &gt; Android &gt; SDK Manager, make sure you have these modules
   installed:
   * Tools &gt; Android SDK Platform-tools 19.0.1
   * Tools &gt; Android SDK Build-tools 19.0.3
   * Android 4.3 (API 18) &gt; SDK Platform
   * Extras &gt; Android Support Repository
   * Extras &gt; Android Support Library
 * Compile and run unit-test:
   * Run test server in the terminal: `node test-server`
   * In Android Studio, right-click on strong-remoting-android and 
     select "Run All Tests"
   * Add an emulator configuration in AVD manager (you will do this only once)
